                <p>We divide the value of a liter of alcool by that of petrol.</p>
                <p>When the result is less than 0.7, the recommendation is to fill up with alcool. If higher, the recommendation is to choose petrol.</p>
                <p>Example: if alcool costs £185.9 and petrol £355.5, the result of dividing the former by the latter is 0.52 less than 0.7. Therefore, it is more advantageous to supply with alcool.</p>
